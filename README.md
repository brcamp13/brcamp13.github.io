Personal website. 
Does not perform well on mobile, so I suggest avoiding visiting it anywhere other than a desktop/laptop until I fix it.
(UPDATE)--> In the creation of this site, I misused the bootstrap jumbotron component. The jumbotron component should not be used to store the entirety of a webpage's content. I should have instead used a simple bootstrap grid in order to implement content on all other pages than the homepage. This mistake has been recognized and will not be repeated going forward. So instead of fixing it right now (when my time is quite limited), I will be moving onto other web-based projects with my newly-gained knowledge.
